### desktop app

- **paid desktop app**: offers priority support, 1-year updates, and exclusive features. users can download and install the desktop app directly from the official site.
- **free desktop app**: open-source and available to build yourself. installation requires building from the source code or sending a pr to the repository. both options provide a fully functional desktop application with all key features.

</MotionDiv>

### manual build

for users preferring full control or customization, building the app manually from the repository is an option. this method requires rust and other necessary dependencies. follow the provided build guide to compile the app.
